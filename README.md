# Data Governance Schema

## Introduction

This scheme is based on the [Data Beliefs](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/data-beliefs-eugene-morozov/) I outlined in the LinkedIn article back in 2022. It is formalising Terms, Concepts, Data Containers, Data Elements and Data Ownership.

## Usage

Import the schema into [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) with [Taxonomies for Confluence](https://dalstonsemantics.com/services/taxonomies-for-confluence/) add-on and use it to govern your organisation's data.

## Design Decisions

1. Following schema.org naming convention for properties (e.g. classification rather than hasClassification) to increase readability and adoption.
1. Only using "has" and "is" in property URIs and labels when it helps make the meaning clear (e.g. hasBroaderConcept rather than broader as in SKOS) to increase readability and adoption.
1. Doing away with domain and range and using names of the classes in the UIRs of the properties and, in most cases, in the labels
